While the results show that the dual-slope large-scale path loss model can slightly reduce RMS errors compared to its single-slope counterpart in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions, the improvement is not significant enough to warrant adopting the dual- slope path loss model. Furthermore, the shadow fading magnitude versus distance is explored, showing a slight increasing trend in LOS and a decreasing trend in NLOS based on the Aalborg data, but more measurements are necessary to gain a better knowledge of the UMa channels at centimeter- and millimeter-wave frequency bands.},

The objective is to build an operator-defined RAN architecture (and associated interfaces) on open hardware that provides intelligent radio control for beyond fifth generation (5G) as well as future sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. Specifically, the open-radio access network (O-RAN) alliance has been formed by merging xRAN forum and C-RAN alliance to formally define the requirements that would help achieve this objective. Owing to the importance of O-RAN in the current wireless landscape, this article provides an introduction to the concepts, principles, and requirements of the Open RAN as specified by the O-RAN alliance. In order to illustrate the role of intelligence in O-RAN, we propose an intelligent radio resource management scheme to handle traffic congestion and demonstrate its efficacy on a real-world dataset obtained from a large operator. A high-level architecture of this deployment scenario that is compliant with the O-RAN requirements is also discussed. The article concludes with key technical challenges and open problems for future research and development.},

In these settings, line-of-sight (LoS) connections are easily interrupted by moving obstacles like humans and vehicles. The proposed approach, coined as Radar-aided Dynamic blockage Recognition (RaDaR), leverages radar measurements and federated learning (FL) to train a dual-output neural network (NN) model capable of simultaneously predicting blockage status and time. This enables determining the optimal point for proactive handover (PHO) or beam switching, thereby reducing the latency introduced by 5G new radio procedures and ensuring high quality of experience (QoE). The framework employs radar sensors to monitor and track objects movement, generating range-angle and range-velocity maps that are useful for scene analysis and predictions. Moreover, FL provides additional benefits such as privacy protection, scalability, and knowledge sharing. The framework is assessed using an extensive real-world dataset comprising mmWave channel information and radar data. The evaluation results show that RaDaR substantially enhances network reliability, achieving an average success rate of 94\% for PHO compared to existing reactive HO procedures that lack proactive blockage prediction. Additionally, RaDaR maintains a superior QoE by ensuring sustained high throughput levels and minimising PHO latency.},

Vehicular users need to be continuously connected to networks that fulfil the constraints of their services. Thus, the implementation of optimal Handover (HO) mechanisms for 5G vehicular architectures is deemed necessary. This work describes a scheme for performing HOs in 5G vehicular networks using the functionalities of the Media-Independent Handover (MIH) and Fast Proxy Mobile IPv6 (FPMIP) standards. The scheme supports both predictive and reactive HO scenarios. A velocity and alternative network monitoring process prepares each vehicle for both HO cases. In the case of predictive HO, each time the satisfaction grade of the vehicular user drops below a predefined threshold, the HO is initiated. On the other hand, in the case of reactive HO, the vehicle loses the connectivity with its serving network and connects to the available network that has obtained the higher ranking from the network selection process. Furthermore, the HO implementation is based on an improved version of the FPMIPv6 protocol. For the evaluation of the described methodology, a 5G vehicular network architecture was simulated. In this architecture, multiple network access technologies coexist, while the experimental results showed that the proposed scheme outperformed existing HO methods.},

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of TCP and UDP when handover is executed in an LTE system. The performance is degraded due to the interference between source and target eNBs (evolved NodeB). Also the handover interruption time negatively affects overall performance. We measure the TCP throughput and the transmission delay of UDP during the handover process by using our indoor and outdoor LTE testbeds. The results show that better TCP throughput performance is obtained by decreasing the A3-offset and the interruption time caused by a handover event is around 80ms.},

	abstract = {With the overcrowded sub-6 GHz bands, millimeter wave (mmWave) bands offer a promising alternative for the next-generation wireless standard, i.e., 5G. However, the susceptibility of mmWave signals to severe pathloss and shadowing requires the use of highly directional antennas to overcome such adverse characteristics. Building a network with directional beams changes the interference behavior, since, narrow beams are vulnerable to blockages. Such sensitivity to blockages causes uncertainty in the interfering node locations and not all of the potential interfering nodes actively contribute to the interference power level at a certain location of the network. Conﬁguration uncertainty may also manifest in the spectral domain while applying dynamic channel and frequency assignment to support 5G applications. In this paper, we ﬁrst propose a blockage model considering mmWave speciﬁcations. Subsequently, using the proposed blockage model, we derive a spatial-spectral interference model for dense ﬁnite-area 5G mmWave networks. The proposed interference model considers randomness of node conﬁguration in both spatial and spectral domains. Finally, the error performance of the network from an arbitrarily located user perspective is calculated in terms of bit error rate and outage probability metrics. The analytical results are validated via Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that considering mmWave speciﬁcations and also randomness in both spectral and spatial node conﬁgurations leads to a noticeably different interference proﬁle.},

Instead we need to solve the techno-economic problem to find both business models and scalable technical solutions that provide extreme area capacity for a given cost and energy consumption.

	abstract = {The use of mobile data is rapidly increasing along with the popularity of smartphones and tablets. The use of indoor data, especially, is expected to be further increased. Indoor cell evolved Node Bs (eNBs) are being installed and they are expected to increase the areas overlaid by indoor and outdoor cells to offload indoor mobile data. We confirmed increases in the handover (HO) failure rates from our analysis of field measurements due to rapid drops in communication quality when user equipment (UE) moved through the doors of a building. If HO failure occurred, the quality of experience (QoE) for real-time applications, e.g., voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) and streaming, degraded due to service interruptions and rebuffering. Thus, it was important to reduce the HO failure rates and disconnection times due to HO failure. We propose a scheme of dual HO triggers that improves the performance of HO from/to an indoor cell while maintaining that of HO between outdoor cells. The proposed scheme introduces events to UE measurement reports to detect rapid drops in communication quality in addition to conventional events that are optimized to the HO between outdoor cells. LTE simulations confirmed that the new HO trigger prevented UE from going out-of-synchronization before the completion of the HO process. The simulation results indicated that the proposed scheme improved indoor-cell-related QoE. More specifically, the number of dropped calls reduced by 87\%, the number of service interruptions for VoIP reduced by 92\%, and the HO failure rate reduced by 23 points. Moreover, the proposed scheme also improved outdoor-cell-related QoE. In short, it significantly improved QoE by reducing HO failure rates in indoor and outdoor cell environments.},

	abstract = {It has been widely speculated that the performance of the next generation based wireless network should meet a transmission speed on the order of 1000 times more than the current cellular communication systems. The frequency bands above 6 GHz have received significant attention lately as a prospective band for next generation 5G systems. The propagation characteristics for 5G networks need to be fully understood for the 5G system design. This paper presents the channel propagation characteristics for a 5G system in line of sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. The diffraction loss (DL) and frequency drop (FD) are investigated based on collected measurement data. Indoor measurement results obtained using a high-resolution channel sounder equipped with directional horn antennas at 3.5 GHz and 28 GHz as a comparative study of the two bands below and above 6 GHz. The parameters for path loss using different path loss models of single and multi-frequencies have been estimated. The excess delay, root mean square (RMS) delay spread and the power delay profile of received paths are analyzed. The results of the path loss models show that the path loss exponent (PLE) in this indoor environment is less than the free space path loss exponent for LOS scenario at both frequencies. Moreover, the PLE is not frequency dependent. The 3GPP path loss models for single and multi-frequency in LOS scenarios have good performance in terms of PLE that is as reliable as the physically-based models. Based on the proposed models, the diffraction loss at 28 GHz is approximately twice the diffraction loss at 3.5 GHz. The findings of the power delay profile and RMS delay spread indicate that these parameters are comparable for frequency bands below and above 6 GHz.},

To enable seamless handovers between indoor and outdoor environments, a mobility prediction of an indoor user is studied by deploying Markov chains. Based on the effect of external factors on the user's mobility, a simulation scenario is created to model the trajectory of an indoor user w.r.t the most visited areas before leaving the indoor environment. Based on that, a method for initializing the transition matrix of Markov chains is proposed, via Q-learning. The proposed solution is compared to a standard online learning Markov chain model in terms of different mobility models and learning rates. Results show that the proposed solution is always able to outperform the standard method in terms of prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {A novel approach to handover management for Long-Term Evolution (LTE) femtocells is presented. Within LTE, the use of self-organizing networks (SONs) is included as standard, and handover management is one of its use cases. Base stations can autonomously decide whether handover should take place and assign the values of relevant parameters. Due to the limited range of femtocells, handover requires more delicate attention in an indoor scenario to allow for efficient and seamless handover from indoor femtocells to outdoor macrocells. As a result of the complexity of the indoor radio environment, frequent ping-pong handovers between the femtocell and macrocell layers can occur. A novel approach requiring a small amount of additional processing using neural networks is presented. A modified self-organizing map (SOM) is used to allow a femtocell to learn the locations of the indoor environment from where handover requests have occurred and, based on previous experience, decide whether to permit or prohibit these handovers. Once the regions that coincide with unnecessary handovers have been detected, the algorithm can reduce the total number of handovers that occur by up to 70\% while still permitting any necessary handover requests to proceed. By reducing the number of handovers, the overall efficiency of the system will improve as the consequence of a reduction in associated but unnecessary signaling. Using machine learning for this task complies with the plug-and-play functionality required from SONs in LTE systems.},

In this paper, we present a two-fold contribution with a comprehensive study on mm-wave handovers. A user-based indoor mobility prediction via Markov chain with an initial transition matrix is proposed in the first step. Based on this acquired knowledge of the user’s movement pattern in the indoor environment, we present a pre-emptive handover algorithm in the second step. This algorithm aims to keep the QoS high for indoor users when transitioning between indoor and outdoor in a heterogeneous network environment.

In a HetNet, small cells are suitable to operate by using mmWave due to its short-range, while macrocells are liable to use long-range radio waves. As a result, the performance of the next generations of wireless communication systems will enhance dramatically. However, the networks' architecture has become more complex and challenging to manage and optimize. Besides, the handover (HO) among small cells is another big challenge and needs to address it on a prior basis. Different techniques are proposed in the literature to improve the current network architectures. In this paper, we provide fundamental background concepts and notions used in the 5G wireless communication system. Besides, we study different HO techniques and management schemes that perform acceptably in the dynamic nature of next-generation wireless networks.

	abstract = {VM (Virtual Machine) live migration is a server virtualization technique for deploying a running VM to another server node while minimizing downtime of service the VM provides. Currently, in cloud data centers, VM live migration is widely used to apply load balancing on CPU workload and network traffic, to reduce electricity consumption, and to provide uninterrupted service during the maintenance of hardware and software updates on servers. It is critical to use VM live migration as a prevention or mitigation measure for possible failure when its indications are detected or predicted. Especially in NFV (Network Function Virtualization) environment, timely use of VNF (Virtual Network Function) live migration can maintain system availability and reduce operator's loss due to service failure. In this paper, we propose a proactive live migration method for vEPC (Virtual Evolved Packet Core) based on failure prediction. A machine learning model learns periodic monitoring data of resource usage and logs from servers and VMs/VNFs to predict future vEPC paging failure probability. We implemented the proposed method in OpenStack-based NFV environment to evaluate the real service performance gains for open source vEPC implementations.},

	abstract = {Cellular networks are undergoing a radical transformation toward disaggregated, fully virtualized, and programmable architectures with increasingly heterogeneous devices and applications. In this context, the open architecture standardized by the O-RAN Alliance enables algorithmic and hardware-independent Radio Access Network (RAN) adaptation through closed-loop control. O-RAN introduces Machine Learning (ML)-based network control and automation algorithms as so-called xApps running on RAN Intelligent Controllers . However, in spite of the new opportunities brought about by the Open RAN, advances in ML-based network automation have been slow, mainly because of the unavailability of large-scale datasets and experimental testing infrastructure. This slows down the development and widespread adoption of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents on real networks, delaying progress in intelligent and autonomous RAN control. In this paper, we address these challenges by discussing insights and practical solutions for the design, training, testing, and experimental evaluation of DRL-based closed-loop control in the Open RAN. To this end, we introduce ColO-RAN, the first publicly-available large-scale O-RAN testing framework with software-defined radios-in-the-loop. Building on the scale and computational capabilities of the Colosseum wireless network emulator, ColO-RAN enables ML research at scale using O-RAN components, programmable base stations, and a “wireless data factory.” Specifically, we design and develop three exemplary xApps for DRL-based control of RAN slicing, scheduling and online model training, and evaluate their performance on a cellular network with 7 softwarized base stations and 42 users. Finally, we showcase the portability of ColO-RAN to different platforms by deploying it on Arena, an indoor programmable testbed. The lessons learned from the ColO-RAN implementation and the extensive results from our first-of-its-kind large-scale evaluation highlight the importance of experimental frameworks for the development of end-to-end intelligent RAN control pipelines, from data analysis to the design and testing of DRL agents. They also provide insights on the challenges and benefits of DRL-based adaptive control, and on the trade-offs associated to training on a live RAN. ColO-RAN and the collected large-scale dataset are publicly available to the research community.},

	abstract = {In typical wireless cellular systems, the handover mechanism involves reassigning an ongoing session handled by one cell into another. In order to support increased capacity requirement and to enable newer use cases, the next generation wireless systems will have a very dense deployment with advanced beam-forming capability. In such systems, providing a better mobility along with enhanced throughput performance requires an improved handover strategy. In this paper, we will detail a novel method for handover optimization in a 5G cellular network using reinforcement learning (RL). In contrast to the conventional method, we propose to control the handovers between base-stations (BSs) using a centralized RL agent. This agent handles the radio measurement reports from the UEs and choose appropriate handover actions in accordance with the RL framework to maximize a long-term utility. We show that the handover mechanism can be posed as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem and solve it using Q-learning method. We analyze the performance of the methods using different propagation and deployment environment and compare the results with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Results indicate a link-beam performance gain of about 0.3 to 0.7 dB for practical propagation environments.},

With the introduction of new enablers for fifth-generation (5G) networks, such as millimetre wave (mm-wave) communications, network densification, Internet of things (IoT), etc., HO management is provisioned to be more challenging as the number of base stations (BSs) per unit area, and the number of connections has been dramatically rising.

To this end, intelligent HO management schemes have been proposed and tested in the literature, paving the way for tackling these challenges more efficiently and effectively. In this survey, we aim at revealing the current status of cellular networks and discussing mobility and HO management in 5G alongside the general characteristics of 5G networks. We provide an extensive tutorial on HO management in 5G networks accompanied by a discussion on machine learning (ML) applications to HO management.

	abstract = {In ultra-dense networks, an enormous number of small base stations (BSs) are required to be deployed, and the number of handovers (HOs) in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) increases as a result. Mobility management with the increasing number of HOs is a critical issue that requires uninterrupted connectivity due to user mobility in HetNets. However, some BSs in the network may be more heavily loaded than their neighbors. Load balancing (LB) involves load transfer from an overloaded BS to an under-loaded neighboring BS for the more load-balanced network. HO and LB are two important issues to improve network performance. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that utilizes user speed and received signal reference power to adapt HO margin (HOM) and time to trigger (TTT). Besides, the proposed algorithm balances the loads among neighbor BSs. Additionally, the proposed algorithm aims to reduce ping-pong HOs (HOPP) and HO failure (HOF) ratios. The simulation results show that the rates of HOPP and HOF are significantly reduced by the proposed algorithm, thus improving network performance under various mobile speeds. Moreover, the results show that the proposed algorithm minimizes the standard deviation of BS loads in the network. The proposed algorithm achieves load balancing and reduces overload during user mobility in HetNets. Therefore, there is more than 60\% improvement in terms of the HOF, and 63\% more balanced network is achieved with the proposed algorithm in the network.},

Firstly, a two-dimension queue is proposed in order to estimate the expected delay on priority scheduling decisions over the IP/Ethernet MAC layer of IP packet transmissions between gNB and the core network. Furthermore, a one-dimension queue is proposed to estimate the average packet waiting time on the RLC radio buffer before being scheduled mainly due to excessive traffic load and designed transmission bandwidth availability.},

	abstract = {The carrier aggregation (CA) technique and Handover Parameters Optimization (HPO) function have been introduced in LTE-Advanced systems to enhance system performance in terms of throughput, coverage area, and connection stability and to reduce management complexity. Although LTE-Advanced has benefited from the CA technique, the low spectral efficiency and high ping-pong effect with high outage probabilities in conventional Carrier Aggregation Deployment Scenarios (CADSs) have become major challenges for cell edge User Equipment (UE). Also, the existing HPO algorithms are not optimal for selecting the appropriate handover control parameters (HCPs). This paper proposes two solutions by deploying a Coordinated Contiguous-CADS (CC-CADS) and a Novel Handover Parameters Optimization algorithm that is based on the Weight Performance Function (NHPO-WPF). The CC-CADS uses two contiguous component carriers (CCs) that have two different beam directions. The NHPO-WPF automatically adjusts the HCPs based on the Weight Performance Function (WPF), which is evaluated as a function of the Signal-to-Interference Noise Ratio (SINR), cell load, and UE’s velocity. Simulation results show that the CC-CADS and the NHPO-WPF algorithm provide significant enhancements in system performance over that of conventional CADSs and HPO algorithms from the literature, respectively. The integration of both solutions achieves even better performance than scenarios in which each solution is considered independently.},

	abstract = {The terahertz (THz) link provides over 100 Gb/s of data transmission rate. However, it is extremely vulnerable to obstacles and requires very narrow (highly directional) beams for highly focused energy radiation. The main task of THz medium access control (MAC) protocol is not channel access collision avoidance; instead, it is to coordinate all the one-hop neighbors for scheduled, antenna-aligned line-of-sight communications. This study aims to build an intelligent MAC scheme for highly mobile THz airborne networks (TANs). Our TAN MAC design has three features as follows. Spatio-temporal TAN state learning: We will build a predictive network state estimation model through deep learning and generative adversarial network. Based on the predicted node/link status, all the one-hop neighbors can prepare well for the antenna alignment and THz channel scheduling. Accurate, two-level MAC operation control: We propose to use nested deep reinforcement learning with outer/inner policy loops for high-/low-level action determination: The outer loop determines the high level, coarse actions (such as antenna codebook selection); the inner loop determines the low-level, fine actions (such as individual beam control) under the selected high-level action. TAN-specific, comprehensive MAC behavior control: Based on the aforementioned deep neighbor adaptation model, we design a complete TAN MAC protocol that considers the routing context and dynamic network topology. Our simulations demonstrate the smooth, high-rate THz communications in MAC layer with resilient RF links under high node mobility.},

	abstract = {Modern wireless communication systems rely heavily on multiple antennas and their corresponding signal processing to achieve optimal performance. As 5G and 6G networks emerge, beamforming and beam management become increasingly complex due to factors such as user mobility, a higher number of antennas, and the adoption of elevated frequencies. Artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning, offers a valuable solution to mitigate this complexity and minimize the overhead associated with beam management and selection, all while maintaining system performance. Despite growing interest in AI-assisted beamforming, beam management, and selection, a comprehensive collection of datasets and benchmarks remains scarce. Furthermore, identifying the most-suitable algorithm for a given scenario remains an open question. This article aimed to provide an exhaustive survey of the subject, highlighting unresolved issues and potential directions for future developments. The discussion encompasses the architectural and signal processing aspects of contemporary beamforming, beam management, and selection.

This paper proposes a new deployment scenario called coordinated contiguous-CADS (CC-CADS), which utilizes two-component carriers (CCs) that operate on two frequencies located in a contiguous band. Each CC antenna is directed to a cell boundary of the other CC. The handover performance of users with various mobility speeds under CC-CADS has been investigated and compared with various deployment scenarios proposed by 3GPP. Simulation results show that the received signal reference power (RSRP) enhancement and performed handover, ping-pong, drop call, and outage probabilities reductions in CC-CADS outperformed the 3GPP’s CADSs, thus leading to reduced interruption time, improved spectral efficiency, and seamless handover.},

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) wireless networks are expected to catalyze the beyond fifth generation (B5G) era. However, due to the directional nature and the line-of-sight demand of THz links, as well as the ultra-dense deployment of THz networks, a number of challenges that the medium access control (MAC) layer needs to face are created. In more detail, the need of rethinking user association and resource allocation strategies by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) capable of providing"real-time"solutions in complex and frequently changing environments becomes evident. Moreover, to satisfy the ultra-reliability and low-latency demands of several B5G applications, novel mobility management approaches are required. Motivated by this, this article presents a holistic MAC layer approach that enables intelligent user association and resource allocation, as well as flexible and adaptive mobility management, while maximizing systems' reliability through blockage minimization. In more detail, a fast and centralized joint user association, radio resource allocation, and blockage avoidance by means of a novel metaheuristic-machine learning framework is documented, that maximizes the THz networks performance, while minimizing the association latency by approximately three orders of magnitude. To support, within the access point (AP) coverage area, mobility management and blockage avoidance, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for beam-selection is discussed. Finally, to support user mobility between coverage areas of neighbor APs, a proactive hand-over mechanism based on AI-assisted fast channel prediction is reported.},

	abstract = {Ensuring a reliable and stable communication throughout the mobility of User Equipment (UE) is one of the key challenges facing the practical implementation of the Fifth Generation (5G) networks and beyond. One of the main issues is the use of suboptimal Handover Control Parameters (HCPs) settings, which are configured manually or generated automatically by certain self-optimization functions. This issue becomes more critical with the massive deployment of small base stations and connected mobile users. This will essentially require an individual handover self-optimization technique for each user individually instead of a unified and centrally configured setting for all users in the cell. In this paper, an Individualistic Dynamic Handover Parameter Optimization algorithm based on an Automatic Weight Function (IDHPO-AWF) is proposed for 5G networks. This algorithm dynamically estimates the HCPs settings for each individual UE based on UE’s experiences. The algorithm mainly depends on three bounded functions and their Automatic Weights levels. First, the bounded functions are evaluated, independently, as a function of the UE’s Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR), cells’ load and UE’s speed. Next, the outputs of the three bounded functions are used as inputs in a new proposed Automatic Weight Function (AWF) to estimate the weight of each output bounded function. After that, the final output is used as an indicator for optimizing HCPs settings automatically for a specific user. The algorithm is validated throughout various mobility conditions in the 5G network. The performance of the analytical HCPs estimation method is investigated and compared with other handover algorithms from the literature. The evaluation comparisons are performed in terms of Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP), Handover Probability (HOP), Handover Ping-Pong Probability (HPPP), and Radio Link Failure (RLF). The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides noticeable enhancements for various mobile speed scenarios as compared to the existing Handover Parameter Self-Optimization (HPSO) algorithms.},

With the emphasis on social distancing as an effective means of curbing the rapid spread of the infection, many individuals, institutions, and industries have had to rely on telecommunications as a means of ensuring service continuity in order to prevent complete shutdown of their operations. This has put enormous pressure on both fixed and mobile networks.

	abstract = {Ensuring a seamless connection during the mobility of various User Equipments (UEs) will be one of the major challenges facing the practical implementation of the Fifth Generation (5G) networks and beyond. Several key determinants will significantly contribute to numerous mobility challenges. One of the most important determinants is the use of millimeter waves (mm-waves) as it is characterized by high path loss. The inclusion of various types of small coverage Base Stations (BSs), such as Picocell, Femtocell and drone-based BSs is another challenge. Other issues include the use of Dual Connectivity (DC), Carrier Aggregation (CA), the massive growth of mobiles connections, network diversity, the emergence of connected drones (as BS or UE), ultra-dense network, inefficient optimization processes, central optimization operations, partial optimization, complex relation in optimization operations, and the use of inefficient handover decision algorithms. The relationship between these processes and diverse wireless technologies can cause growing concerns in relation to handover associated with mobility. The risk becomes critical with high mobility speed scenarios. Therefore, mobility issues and their determinants must be efficiently addressed. This paper aims to provide an overview of mobility management in 5G networks. The work examines key factors that will significantly contribute to the increase of mobility issues.

	abstract = {Mobility management is an important feature in modern wireless networks that can provide seamless and ubiquitous connectivity to mobile users. Due to the dense deployment of small cells and heterogeneous network topologies, the traditional handover control method can lead to various mobility-related problems, such as frequent handovers and handover failures. On the other hand, the mobility management’s maintenance and operation cost is also increased due to increasing node density. In this paper, an autonomous mobility management control approach is proposed to increase the mobility robustness of user equipment (UE) mobility and minimize the operational cost of mobility management. The proposed method is based on reinforcement learning, which can autonomously learn an optimal handover control policy by interacting with the environment. The function approximation approach is adopted to allow reinforcement learning to process a large state and action space. A linear function approximator is used to approximate the state-action value function. Finally, the semi-gradient state-action-reward-state-action (Sarsa) method is implemented to update the approximated state-action function and learn the optimal handover control policy. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the mobility robustness of UE under different speed ranges. Compared with the conventional reference signal received power (RSRP) based approach, the proposed approach can reduce unnecessary handovers by about 20\% and latency by 58\%, while achieving near zero handover failure rate, and increasing throughput by 12\%.},

In this paper, first, a sensitivity analysis of the two main HO parameters, i.e., the HO margin (HOM) and the time-to-trigger (TTT), is carried out for different system load levels and user speeds in a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network. Second, a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) that adaptively modifies HOMs is designed for HO optimization. In this case, different parameter optimization levels (network-wide, cell-wide, and cell-pair-wide) and the impact of measurement errors have been considered. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that tuning HOMs is an effective solution for HO optimization in LTE networks. In addition, the FLC is shown as an effective technique to adapt HOM to different network conditions so that the signaling load in the network is decreased while an admissible level of call dropping is achieved.},

	abstract = {Increasing the deployment density of small base stations (SBS) is a key method designed to satisfy high data traffic in 5th generation mobile network (5G). However, a large number of SBSs in such ultra-dense network (UDN) may cause ping-pong handovers (HOs), accompanied by increased delay and HO failure. In addition, because of the separation of control and data signaling in 5G, the HO procedure must be performed in both layers. In this paper, we introduce an SDN-based intelligent dynamic HO parameter optimization strategy to minimize both HO failures and ping-pong HOs together. The goal of the proposed strategy is to reduce the HO failure rate and redundant HO (i.e. ping-pong HO) while enabling user equipment (UE) to make full use of the benefits of dense deployment of BSs. Simulation results present that the method proposed in this paper effectively suppresses the ping-pong effect and keeps it at a low level in all of the investigated scenes. In addition, compared with the other algorithms, the HO failure rate is significantly reduced and the throughput of UE is greatly increased, especially in the case of high BS density. Therefore, the benefits of intensive BS deployment are retained.},

	abstract = {The massive deployment of small-sized cells for the Fifth Generation (5G) mobile network will increase the Handover Probability (HOP), potentially causing higher Handover Ping-Pong Probability (HPPP) and/or Radio Link Failure (RLF). Inappropriate usage of Handover Control Parameter (HCP) settings may further exasperate this issue. Therefore, Mobility Robustness Optimisation (MRO) has been introduced and further developed as a significant Self-Optimisation Network (SON) function in the 5G network and beyond. The main aim of MRO is to address Mobility Management (MM) issues during user mobility between cells to ensure a smooth connection. Although various algorithms were suggested in the literature, they mostly cater to 4G networks which may not be effective for the 5G network due to different network characterisations. This paper analyses the performance of various MRO algorithms with various system settings and scenarios for the 5G network. The investigated algorithms from the literature include the Distance (Dis), Cost Function (CF), Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) and Handover Performance Indicator (HPI). Validation has been accomplished for different mobility conditions in the 5G network. A simulation based on the MATLAB software has been conducted using various system tools. The evaluation analysis is in terms of Signal to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR), HPPP and RLF effects since these are major indicators in assessing system performance and selecting the handover decision during user mobility. The simulation outcomes show that the HPI algorithm performance is more reactive to mobile speed scenarios over time, significantly reducing the HPPP compared to the other algorithms which do not provide large reactions in the same conditions. Simultaneously, the HPI algorithm exhibits the highest RLF and SINR from among the other algorithms. The distance algorithm is the best in terms of RLF and SINR, achieving an acceptable level in terms of HPPP. These results point to that the MRO algorithm that operate based on distance is the most robust compared to the other investigated algorithms, confirming the potential of the Dis approach for the 5G network.},

	abstract = {The future fifth generation (5G) wireless communications support the ultra-dense networks where deployments of a large number of small cells coexist with current 4G networks. However, the dense small cell deployment is facing a technical challenge in mobility management due to the increased number of handovers (HOs), especially in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). The increasing probability of HOs may cause HO failure (HOF) or HO ping-pong (HOPP) which degrades the system performance. To solve this problem, we propose a weighted fuzzy self-optimization (WFSO) approach for the optimization of the handover control parameters (HCPs). In this approach, the HO decision relies on three considered attributes: signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, traffic load of serving and target base station, and user equipment’s velocity. The self-optimized HCPs, namely the HO margin and time-to-trigger are adjusted according to the current status of these attributes to improve the HO performance. Simulation results indicate that the proposed WFSO approach significantly lowers the rates of HOPP, radio link failure and HOF in comparison with the other algorithms found in the literature.},

Handover in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) has gained attention, especially when 5G ultradense small cells coexist with the current 4G networks. Handover failure is one of the main issues in mobility, and it can be avoided by adjusting handover control parameters (HCPs): time-to-trigger (TTT) and handover margin (HOM).

	abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) network is an upcoming standard for wireless communications that coexists with the current 4G network to increase the throughput. The deployment of ultra-dense small cells (UDSC) over a macro-cell layer yields multi-tier networks, which are known as heterogeneous networks (HetNets). HetNets play a key role in the cellular network to provide services to numerous users. However, the number of handovers (HOs) and radio link failure (RLF) greatly increase due to the increase in the UDSC in the network. Therefore, mobility management becomes a very important function in a self-organizing network to improve the system performance. In this paper, we propose a velocity-based self-optimization algorithm to adjust the HO control parameters in 4G/5G networks. The proposed algorithm utilizes the user’s received power and speed to adjust the HO margin and the time to trigger during the user’s mobility in the network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a remarkable reduction in the rate of ping-pong HOs and RLF compared with other existing algorithms, thereby outperforming such algorithms by an average of more than 70\% for all HO performance metrics.},

A tremendous increase in handover (HO) scenarios and HO rates will occur. Ensuring stable and reliable connection through the mobility of user equipment (UE) will become a major problem in future mobile networks. This problem will be magnified with the use of suboptimal handover control parameter (HCP) settings, which can be configured manually or automatically. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the impact of different HCP settings on the performance of 5G network. Several system scenarios are proposed and investigated based on different HCP settings and mobile speed scenarios. The different mobile speeds are expected to demonstrate the influence of many proposed system scenarios on 5G network execution. We conducted simulations utilizing MATLAB software and its related tools. Evaluation comparisons were performed in terms of handover probability (HOP), ping-pong handover probability (PPHP) and outage probability (OP). The 5G network framework has been employed to evaluate the proposed system scenarios used. The simulation results reveal that there is a trade-off in the results obtained from various systems. The use of lower HCP settings provides noticeable enhancements compared to higher HCP settings in terms of OP. Simultaneously, the use of lower HCP settings provides noticeable drawbacks compared to higher HCP settings in terms of high PPHP for all scenarios of mobile speed. The simulation results show that medium HCP settings may be the acceptable solution if one of these systems is applied. This study emphasises the application of automatic self-optimisation (ASO) functions as the best solution that considers user experience.},

While handover failures caused by radio link failure (RLF) significantly reduces the reliability of network operation, ping-pongs drastically waste signaling resources. In the upcoming fifth-generation (5G) networks especially, a complex deployment of small cells can exacerbate the two problems, even though the network can be integrated with a self-organizing network (SON), which is an automation-based solution. Due to the coupling of RLFs and ping-pongs as explained in the literature, it is difficult to analyze handovers and minimize both RLFs and ping-pongs simultaneously. In this paper, we model a handover procedure with geometric elements (Apollonian circles and the straight line), and analyze handover performance. The analysis provides an optimal handover setting for minimizing both RLFs and ping-pongs together, whereas previous works only considered trade-offs between them. We show that our analysis accurately estimates the optimal setting by comparing it with an NS-3 simulation. From the analysis, different environments can require different optimal values: fading (as well as interference) limit the optimal values; user speed has a scaling impact; and time-to-trigger has a shifting effect.},

To this end, intelligent HO management schemes have been proposed and tested in the literature, paving the way for tackling these challenges more efficiently and effectively.

In the recent years, several studies have been conducted to address the issues related to Handover (HO) self-optimization in Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) for Fourth Generation (4G) and Fifth Generation (5G) mobile networks. Various solutions have been developed to determine or estimating the optimum and ideal settings of Handover Control Parameters (HCPs), such as Time-To-Trigger (TTT) and Handover Margin (HOM). However, the complexity, high requirements, and the upcoming structure of ultra-dense HetNets require more advanced HO self-optimization techniques for future implementation. This paper studies HO self-optimization techniques that may implemented in the next-generation mobile HetNets by reviewing state-of-the-art algorithms. The solutions discussed in this survey are more focus on Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO), which is a significant self-optimization function in 4G and 5G mobile networks. The applied solutions will preserve the continuous connection between the User Equipment (UE) and eNBs during UE mobility, thereby enhancing connection quality. The various algorithms and techniques applied to HO have revealed different outcomes. This paper discusses the pros and cons of these techniques, and further examines HO self-optimization challenges and solutions. New future directions for the implementation of HO self-optimization are also identified.

Heterogeneous networks (HetNets), created by the joint installation of macro cells and a large number of densely deployed small cells, are considered an important solution to deal with the increasing network capacity demands and provide high coverage to wireless users in future fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. Due to the increasing complexity of network topology in 5G HetNets with the integration of many different base station types, in 5G architecture mobility management has many challenges. Intense deployment of small cells, along with many advantages it provides, brings important mobility management problems such as frequent handover (HO), HO failure, HO delays, ping-pong HO and high energy consumption which will result in lower user experience and heavy signal loads. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study on the mobility management in 5G HetNet in terms of radio resource control, the initial access and registration procedure of the user equipment (UE) to the network, the paging procedure that provides the location of the UE within the network, connected mode mobility management schemes, beam level mobility and beam management. Besides, this paper addresses the challenges and suggest possible solutions for the 5G mobility management.},

	abstract = {Due to the diversity of mobile services and rising user expectations, mobile network management has changed its focus from Quality of Service (QoS) to Quality of Experience (QoE). As a consequence, classical network optimization procedures must be updated accordingly. One of these optimization procedures is Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO), whose aim is to improve HandOver (HO) performance by reducing HO failures. In this work, a novel QoE-aware MRO algorithm is proposed considering a multi-service scenario. Unlike previous approaches, whose aim is to increase successful handover rates, the optimization aim in this work is two-folded: to improve cell edge QoE while improving successful handover rates in the whole network. For this purpose, the handover trigger point, defined by the pair of HO control parameters HO margin and Time to Trigger, are tuned on a per-adjacency basis according to QoE and HO failure measurements. Method assessment is based on a dynamic system-level simulator implementing a realistic LTE scenario with multiple services. Results show that the proposed QoE-aware MRO algorithm improves cell edge QoE throughout the network while increasing the percentage of successful handovers compared to traditional approaches.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a machine learning−based mobility robustness optimization algorithm to optimize handover parameters for seamless mobility under dynamic small-cell networks. Small cells can be arbitrarily deployed, portable, and turned on and off to fulfill wireless traffic demands or energy efficiency. As a result, the small-cell network topology dynamically varies challenging network optimization, especially handover optimization. Previous studies have only considered dynamics due to user mobility in a specific static network topology. To optimize handovers under dynamic network topologies, together with user mobility, we propose an algorithm consisting of two steps: topology adaptation and mobility adaptation. To adapt to a dynamic topology, the algorithm obtains prior knowledge, which presents a belief distribution of the optimal handover parameters, for the current network topology as coarse optimization. In the second step, the algorithm fine-tunes the handover parameters to adapt to user mobility based on reinforcement learning, which utilizes the knowledge obtained during the first step. Under a dynamic small-cell network, we showed that the proposed algorithm reduced adaptation time to 4.17\% of the time needed by a comparative machine–based algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm improved the user satisfaction rate to 416.7\% compared to the previous work.},

	abstract = {Mobility management is essential in mobile communication networks to provide a smooth connection during users’ mobility. Handover control parameters (HCPs), such as handover margin (HOM) and time-to-trigger (TTT), are major and essential factors in mobility management that must be defined carefully to make efficient handover (HO) procedures. Their impact becomes more critical with the deployment of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks and beyond (B5G). This is due to the different characterizations of next mobile networks, such as the use of millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands, the ultradense deployment of small base stations (BSs), large mobile connection traffic growth, and other more critical factors. The case becomes more sensitive with the high mobility speed scenarios. This study proposes different HCP system settings to be investigated and analyzed over B5G networks. They will be investigated with various mobile speed scenarios to illustrate their impact on the network performance. Various key performance indicators (KPIs) are considered to evaluate and validate system performance, such as reference signal received power (RSRP), HO probability (HOP), HO ping-pong (HOPP), radio link failure (RLF), HO interruption time (HIT), and HO failure (HOF). Results show that the various system settings provide different and significant impacts on the performance of B5G networks. Furthermore, the setting of HCP1 obtained the best performance in RSRP and RLF with -69.7 dBm and 4.8\%, respectively, while the optimum performance of HOPP, HIT, HOP, and HOF is achieved in the HCP6 setting with 0\%, 0.02 ms, 0.05\%, and 0\%, respectively. Moreover, the overall outcome of all HCP settings is 54.94\%. These results indicate a tradeoff between RLF and HOPP with various HCP settings in B5G mobile networks. Thus, the HCP system settings must be adjusted carefully considering other factors, such as mobile environment and use case.},

	abstract = {For reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks, this paper proposes cooperative sensing with multi-camera operation in an image-to-decision proactive handover framework that directly maps images to a handover decision. In the framework, camera images are utilized to allow for the prediction of blockage effects in a mmWave link, whereby a network controller triggers a handover in a proactive fashion. Furthermore, direct mapping allows for the scalability of the number of pedestrians. This paper experimentally investigates the feasibility of adopting cooperative sensing with multiple cameras that can compensate for one another's blind spots. The optimal mapping is learned via deep reinforcement learning to resolve the high dimensionality of images from multiple cameras. An evaluation based on experimentally obtained images and received powers verifies that a mapping that enhances channel capacity can be learned in a multi-camera operation. The results indicate that our proposed framework with multi-camera operation outperforms a conventional framework with single-camera operation in terms of the average capacity.},

At the same time, its high bandwidth and highly directional antennas allow for unprecedented accuracy in wireless sensing and localization applications. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze mmWave localization and find that it is either extremely accurate or has a very high error, since there is significant mmWave coverage via reflections and even through walls. As a consequence, sub-6 GHz technology can not only provide (coarse) localization where mmWave is not available, but is also critical to decide among multiple candidate antennas and APs for accurate mmWave localization. Based on these insights, we design a high-accuracy joint mmWave and sub-6 GHz location system. We enable CSI-based angle estimation and FTM-based ranging on off-the-shelf mmWave devices to implement our mechanism and carry out an extensive measurement campaign. Our system is the first to achieve 18 cm median location error with off-the-shelf devices under their normal mode of operation. We further release the location system (and in particular the CSI and FTM functionality) as well as the trace data from the measurement campaign to the research community.},

	abstract = {Technical network challenges in 5G relates to handover authentication, user privacy protection and resource management. Due to interoperability requirements among the heterogeneous networks (Hetnets), the security requirements for 5G are high compared to 2G, 3G and 4G. The current 5G handover protocols are based on either fuzzy logic (FL), artificial neural networks (ANN), blockchain, software defined network (SDN), or Multi-layer Feed Forward Network (MFNN). These protocols have either long latencies or focus on either security or quality of services parameters such as user satisfaction. The usage of these inefficient authentication schemes during 5G handovers lead to performance degradation in heterogeneous cells and increases the delay. In addition, 5G networks experience frequent handover failures and increased handover delays. Consequently, the provision of strong security, privacy and low latency handovers is required for the successful deployment of 5G networks such as 5G wireless local area networks (5G-WLAN) heterogeneous networks. These new requirements, coupled with demands for higher scalability, reliability, security, data rates, quality of service (QoS), and support for internet of everything (IoE) have seen the shift from 5G to beyond 5G (B5G). However, 5G and B5G are incapable of providing the complete requirements of IoE such as enhanced security and QoS. This paper sought to develop an ANN-FL protocol that addressed both security and QoS in 5G and B5G networks. The simulation results showed that the developed protocol was robust against attacks such de-synchronization and tracing attacks and yielded a 27.1\% increase in handover success rate, a 27.3\% reduction in handover failure rate, and a 24.1\% reduction in ping pong handovers.},

	abstract = {The massive growth of mobile users will spread to significant numbers of small cells for the Fifth Generation (5G) mobile network, which will overlap the fourth generation (4G) network. A tremendous increase in handover (HO) scenarios and HO rates will occur. Ensuring stable and reliable connection through the mobility of user equipment (UE) will become a major problem in future mobile networks. This problem will be magnified with the use of suboptimal handover control parameter (HCP) settings, which can be configured manually or automatically. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the impact of different HCP settings on the performance of 5G network. Several system scenarios are proposed and investigated based on different HCP settings and mobile speed scenarios. The different mobile speeds are expected to demonstrate the influence of many proposed system scenarios on 5G network execution. We conducted simulations utilizing MATLAB software and its related tools. Evaluation comparisons were performed in terms of handover probability (HOP), ping-pong handover probability (PPHP) and outage probability (OP). The 5G network framework has been employed to evaluate the proposed system scenarios used. The simulation results reveal that there is a trade-off in the results obtained from various systems. The use of lower HCP settings provides noticeable enhancements compared to higher HCP settings in terms of OP. Simultaneously, the use of lower HCP settings provides noticeable drawbacks compared to higher HCP settings in terms of high PPHP for all scenarios of mobile speed. The simulation results show that medium HCP settings may be the acceptable solution if one of these systems is applied. This study emphasises the application of automatic self-optimisation (ASO) functions as the best solution that considers user experience.},

	abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) networks offer ultra-low latencies, higher reliability, scalability, data rates and capacities to support applications such as vehicular communications, internet of everything (IoE) and device to device (D2D) communication. In spite of these excellent features, user privacy, resource management and handover authentications present some challenges. To facilitate seamless connectivity in 5G and B5G networks, numerous machine learning schemes have been developed to facilitate target cell selection based on parameters such as signal strength and signal to noise ratio (SNR). However, most of these approaches concentrate on performance enhancements, ignoring security and privacy issues. On their part, majority of the conventional handover authentication schemes exhibit long latencies which contravenes 5G and B5G requirements. Moreover, the base stations in these networks have very small footprints and hence require the deployment of numerous base stations within the coverage area. This serves to compound performance, security and privacy issues due to the resulting frequent handovers. In this paper, a multilayer neural network (MLNN) privacy and security preservation protocol is presented. To facilitate target cell selection, parameters that took user satisfaction, network, user equipment (UE) and service requirements into consideration were deployed so as to enhance both quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) during and after handover. For handover security, timestamps, ephemerals and random nonces were deployed during handover authentication to offer both security and privacy. Formal security analysis using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) showed that the proposed protocol offered strong mutual authentication among the communicating entities. On the other hand, informal security analysis showed that the proposed protocol offers perfect forward key secrecy and is robust against attacks such as impersonation and packet replays. In addition, performance evaluation showed that it has the lowest communication costs and average computation overheads. Moreover, it exhibited a 27.1\% increase in handover success rate, and a 24.1\% reduction in ping pong rate.},

Increasing network limits to fulfill the developing needs of consumers has prompted the advancement of cell correspondence networks from 1G to 5G. Many heterogeneous connections request higher information rates, lesser postponements, improved framework limit, and predominant throughput. The accessible range of assets is restricted and should be deftly utilized by mobile network operators (MNOs) to cope with the rising demands. This paper presents a detailed survey on vehicular communications systems, their forms, and handover in each category in 5G networks.},

	abstract = {5G has been under standardization for over a decade and will drive the world's mobile technologies in the decades to come. One of the cornerstones of the 5G standard is its security, also for devices that move frequently between networks, such as autonomous vehicles, and must therefore be handed over from one network operator to another. We present a novel, comprehensive, formal analysis of the security of the device handover protocols specified in the 5G standard. Our analysis covers both handovers within the 5G core network, as well as fallback methods for backwards compatibility with 4G/LTE. We identify four main handover protocols and formally model them in the security protocol verification tool Tamarin. Using these models, we determine for each protocol the minimal set of security assumptions required for its intended security goals to be met. Understanding these requirements is essential when designing devices and other protocols that depend on the reliability and security of network handovers.},

	abstract = {Mobility management is the key feature of cellular networks. When integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into cellular networks, their cell association needs to be carefully managed for coexistence with other cellular users. UAVs move in three dimensions and may traverse several cells on their flight path, and so may be subject to several handovers. In order to enable research on mobility management with UAV users, this paper describes the design, implementation, and testing methodology for handover experiments with aerial users. We leverage software-defined radios (SDRs) and implement a series of tools for preparing the experiment in the laboratory and for taking it outdoors for field testing. We use solely commercial off-the-shelf hardware, open-source software, and an experimental license to enable reproducible and scalable experiments. Our initial outdoor results with two SDR base stations connected to an open-source software core network, implementing the 4G long-term evolution protocol, and one low altitude UAV user equipment demonstrate the handover process.},

First, we provide a comprehensive overview of the X2 handover procedure, in an end-to-end cellular network architecture and detail the handover condition, message flow and latency decomposition. We then describe our OpenAirInterface based implementation and end-to-end experimentation of LTE X2 handover in a full-SDR environment. Finally, we analyze the performance in terms of end-to-end throughput and of latency for each step of the handover procedure and compare it to the state of the art of X2 handover experimentation.},
