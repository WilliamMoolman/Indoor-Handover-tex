%         \item This dissertation contains a preliminary investigation into the issues faced by the introduction of mobile networks into indoor environments.
%         \item Very little literature exists on this topic
%         \item A indoor 4G network testbed was used to run a multitude of experiments
%         \item From the data gathered there were four main issues faced that must be addressed that challenge indoor deployments
%         \item  Ping Pong handover was a major issue, with the density of cells exponentially increasing the rate
%         \item To better handle the ping pong rates, deviations from the standard hysteresis and TTT are necessary, we found that using CQI and pseudo localisation gave the best results
%         \item Further and more complex environments are required to better test these results and investigate further issues
%     \end{itemize}
