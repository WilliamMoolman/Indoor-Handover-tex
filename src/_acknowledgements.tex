I want to begin by thanking my dissertation supervisor, Alejandro Blanco. I am incredibly grateful for his commitment to his role as supervisor — his consistent advice and unwavering support were invaluable to completing this project.

I would also like to thank three of the University of Edinburgh’s Networked Systems Group doctoral students: Ujjwaal Pawar, Andrew Ferguson and Jon Larrea. When beginning my experimentation process, I was extremely grateful to Jon for granting me permission to use his set of Kubernetes deployment tools for the testbed and to Ujjwaal, who provided me with invaluable support, both helping with the testbed setup and explaining how the LTE system worked. Andrew helped me diagnose and fix any problems I encountered throughout my project.

I would finally like to thank my partner for her moral support throughout the dissertation writing process.
