\abstract{
This skeleton demonstrates how to use the \texttt{infthesis} style for
undergraduate dissertations in the School of Informatics. It also emphasises the
page limit, and that you must not deviate from the required style.
The file \texttt{skeleton.tex} generates this document and should be used as a
starting point for your thesis. Replace this abstract text with a concise
summary of your report.
