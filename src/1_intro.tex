\chapter{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mobile networks are increasingly looking to serve consumers in indoor environment.
    \item Classic algorithms developed in outdoor environments will not necessarily translate to indoors
    \item Simulation data works well for investigating outdoors as propogation loss can be simulated
    \item Indoors must be gathered using real world data for analysis to be relevant
    \item Mainting a stable testbed is non-trivial. The research group has a testbed but much must be done to gather such data
    \item Using srsRAN is best due to its logging verbosity
    \item Using Mobile UEs is good for accuracy, but data cannot be dumped from proprietary chips
    \item Laptop + USRP works best
    \item Previous studies do not exist
    \item
